## Libraries

### [ResourceLib](/Libraries/ResourceLib)

A collection of libraries that allow converting various game resources to JSON and back, each targetting a specific Hitman game. The library exposes a C interface that can be directly integrated into third party tools, without additional dependencies. You can also find a C# / .NET wrapper around ResourceLib [here](/Libraries/ResourceLib/ResourceLib.cs).

Currently supported games and resource types:

| Game | Supported Resources |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| Hitman 3 | `TEMP`, `TBLU`, `AIRG`, `ATMD`*, `CBLU`, `CPPT`, `CRMD`, `DSWB`, `ECPB`, `GFXF`, `GIDX`, `VIDB`, `WSGB`, `ENUM`, `RTLV`, `UICB` |
| Hitman 2 | `TEMP`, `TBLU`, `AIRG`, `ATMD`*, `CBLU`, `CPPT`, `CRMD`, `DSWB`, `ECPB`, `GFXF`, `GIDX`, `VIDB`, `WSGB`, `ENUM`, `RTLV`, `UICB` |
| Hitman 2016 | `TEMP`, `TBLU`, `AIRG`, `ATMD`*, `CBLU`, `CPPT`, `CRMD`, `DSWB`, `GFXF`, `GIDX`, `VIDB`, `WSGB`, `RTLV`, `UICB` |
| Hitman Absolution* | `TEMP`, `TBLU`, `AIRG`, `CBLU`, `CPPT`, `CRMD`, `DSWB`, `GFXF`, `GIDX`, `WSGB` |

*`*` Experimental*

### [CodeGenLib](/Libraries/CodeGenLib)

A companion library to ResourceLib, used to generate conversion and generation code for a specific game. It can be injected into any of the supported titles, and it will generate the various files that ResourceLib needs. Usually used to update ResourceLib after a title update. More information on updating ResourceLib using this tool can be found below.

### [NavWeakness](/Libraries/NavWeakness)

A library containing basic research on the NavPower navmesh format. It currently accepts a navmesh resource and converts it to a JSON representation that can be rendered by the NavViewer tool mentioned below.

## Tools

### [ResourceTool](/Tools/ResourceTool)

A command-line tool that allows converting various game resources to JSON and back, using ResourceLib. It supports all the game and resource formats that ResourceLib supports.

### [CodeGen](/Tools/CodeGen)

A tool that automatically detects any supported running game processes and injects CodeGenLib into them, using it to generate code for ResourceLib.

### [PropertyBundler](/Tools/PropertyBundler)

A tool that post-processes the property text files generated by CodeGenLib into a form usable by ResourceLib.

### [ModuleInfoParser](/Tools/ModuleInfoParser)

A tool that parses Hitman Absolution debug depot moduleinfo files and generates a list of properties and enums for use by CodeGenLib. This is needed because this information is stripped from the executable in Hitman Absolution.

### [NavTool](/Tools/NavTool)

A command-line tool that allows converting NavPower navmeshes into a custom JSON representation, using the NavWeakness library.

### [NavViewer](/Tools/NavViewer)

A web-based viewer of NavPower navmeshes, which uses the output of the NavTool to show a realtime 3D representation of the navmesh. Useful for validating research.

## Updating ResourceLib after a title update

Almost every time there's a new game / title update, the ResourceLib for that game needs to updated. The following steps are necessary to perform that update:

1. Start the game in question and wait until you reach the main menu.
2. Run the `CodeGen` tool, making sure that `CodeGenLib.dll` is in the same directory as it.
3. Open the directory with the name of the game that was created in the directory of the `CodeGen` tool.
4. Copy all the files starting with `ZHM` into the appropriate `ResourceLib` directory (for example for Hitman 3 copy them to `Libraries/ResourceLib/Src/Generated/HM3`).
5. Run the `PropertyBundler` tool by passing the path to the directory of ZHMTools as an argument to it (for example `PropertyBundler.exe C:\Path\To\ZHMTools`.
6. Re-compile `ResourceLib`.
